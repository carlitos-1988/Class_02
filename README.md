## Project About Me

I built this site so that you can get to know me better (not much). The purpose is to provide a quick intro of myself and ask questions based on what you have read.

a lot of interesting things for this assignment had a hard time counting the mumber of loops in my head. Also, struggeled with what is in scope vs out of scope for the loops. Lastly I forgot that == will check against the variable from string to a primitive data type. I know this should have worked but for some reason it did not work for me.
